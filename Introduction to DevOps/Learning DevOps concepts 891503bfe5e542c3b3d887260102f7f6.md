### What does DevOps mean?

DevOps is a set of practices that works to automate and integrate the processes between software development and IT teams, so they can build, test, and release software faster and more reliably.

### How is DevOps different from Agile?

Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster. On the other hand DevOps is a technical practice, the main difference is that Agile is just as management process level. DevOps is in charge to implement the technology to become true the results.

### **What is the origin of DevOps?**

The term DevOps was born almost accidentally. In 2008, Andrew Clay Shafer (creator of Puppet Labs and now at Pivotal) and Patrick Debois started working to bring the Agile philosophy to the world of systems administration, the result of this was published in 2009 under the name "DevOps ".

DevOps (English acronym for development -development- and operations -operations-) is a software engineering practice that aims to unify software development (Dev) and software operation (Ops).

It is very common to see that both Agile and DevOps go hand in hand because of their compatibility and objectives, but it is incorrect to say that one is the evolution of the another due to they both come from the same philosophy.

### **How can DevOps improve team relationships?**

Teams who fully embrace DevOps practices work smarter and faster, and deliver better quality to their customers. The increased use of automation and cross-functional collaboration reduces complexity and errors, which in turn improves the Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) when incidents and outages occur. Also, DevOps-focused organizations can build reliable services faster through collaborative team relationships and more transparent workflows. By creating visibility into projects and the prioritization of those projects, teams can better work together.

### **Explain Continuous Integration.**

Ci consists of automating the integration of changes from an entire development team in the same project.

Usually it goes through testing as unit or code analysis and build process until we have an artifact with which we can deploy in the future.

### Explain Continuous Delivery.

Continuous Delivery is the process where it is automated until the delivery of the artifact to a repository, unlike Continuous Deployment, which is automation until the deployment of the application.

### Explain Continuous Testing:

Continuous testing is the process of running automated tests as part of the software delivery process to make it happen as quickly as possible. It evolves into so-called test automation to increase the pace of application development and delivery.

---

### Explain Continuous Monitoring.

Continuous Monitoring is to verify all the status and the behavior of the program, with the monitoring tools. To see what is happening with the application that the team made, who many resources consume when the program it's running, to see who many data it's saving or transferring, and the most important part to monitoring if the program crash or if it passes the limits that we established. 

### What is the difference between Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment?

Continuous Delivery means when you have ready your changes for release to repository, you have finished your duties on the code. And Continuous Deployment when this changes have been implemented to production.

### **What is configuration management in terms of infrastructure and mention a few popular tools used?**

We are referring to the set up of all computing resources required to create the infrastructure to perform DevOps actions. This could be servers, networks of configurations and other resources.

- GIT
- Docker
- Terraform
- Ansible
- Puppet

### Which scripting tools are used in DevOps?:

- **Python Scripting in DevOps:** In IT Infrastructure, Python has become an all-purpose language. It is required to build Cloud Infrastructure Projects like OpenStack.
- **Ruby:** It provides a flexible approach towards programming as DevOps can make numerous alterations in the parts of scripting to fulfill the requirements.
- **Bash** **Scripting:** Bash is one of the most frequently used Unix Shell Scripting and provides good support. Bash Scripting and Shell Scripting languages support thousands of Linux systems around the world.
- **Go:** The Go DevOps Scripting tool was introduced in 2009 and has made quite a good impact in the market since its inception. DevOps Programming Language ‘Go’ was built on the foundation of C Language.
